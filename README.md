# OBJECTIVE
I had to recreate the Cache Bank website and give it functionality using HTML, CSS and Tailwind

# COMPONENT 1
I had to create a responsive navigation. I added the bank's logo, four navigation links within the same document, a log in and sign up button. I styled the sign up button differently and gave it some changes when hovered over. I  also made sure to make the navigation links responsive and look like a menu when the screen is smaller. 

# COMPONENT 2
The second part was about the product of the company. I created a header, and followed it up with a paragraph. I also added a hero-image logo on the side. I added two buttons and styled them, making them change colour when hovered over. Lastly, I added some logos that are in partnership with the company at the bottom.

# COMPONENT 3
I then moved on to the features' section. I did almost the same thing as above by adding a header and a paragraph. However, this time around, I introduced grid, this allowed me to put my content into different "blocks" and columns. I made it so that for larger screens, I'd have 3 columns, for  medium screens, 2 columns, and then for mobile devices to just have the different blocks stacking on each other. I gave these blocks a different background colour when they are hovered over.

# COMPONENT 4
I added the stats of the company and used a "countto" method to make them look like they were counting up to a specific number. I proceeded to add more headers and a paragraph. This is a section also for when you want to join the Cache Bank, it shows you the steps you need to take. And for this, I added a grid again, and numbered the different "blocks" using different colours. I also added a "getting-started" image. 

# COMPONENT 5
For this last section, I divided my code into two. The first part gives the contact details of the company, either by email, phone or their physical address. I used a grid here as well for the three details. I added a logo with the svg that was already given in this portfolio file, and made sure to centre the logos and the texts. I made their background white to create a contrast between its background and that of the entire body. I added a footer at the end, this included the company's copyright and its social media links.

# RESOURCES
I used the material on LMS, along with the component videos and other resources online.
